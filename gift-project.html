		 So for this assignment I was given the task of giving a well thought out and creative gift to someone that I know well. I knew that I wanted to give the gift to my roommate and knowing her obsession with iconic horror movies I knew I wanted to do something based off of that. We were also in the process of redecorating our apartment at the time and didn't have any lamps so making candles seemed like the perfect option.I decided to make the candles intentionally messy looking to go along with the horror based theme and placed photos of her favorite characters on the front. In the end she really liked the gift and it was realy interesting giving a gift that was so specifically catered to one person for no specific occasion.
