		<h1>HThe Pen is Mightier</h1>
			<p> The <span class="emphasis"> New Yorker</span> is nothing if not consistent. Since the New Yorker started as a weekly magazine in 1925, the magazine has changed only infinitesimally. Although, they’ve expanded their brand over the years by creating a website and an app to go along with the publication, the design of the New Yorker is one of the few, if not the only, brands that has stayed so true to the nature of the original design.  Even the website is still very consistent to the original design of the magazine. This seems a pretty hard feat to accomplish considering the original magazine was published almost 90 years prior</p>. 
			<p>As far as the basic aesthetics of the website, it is laid out in a way that most would probably consider typical for a news or editorial website, with the top stories featured towards the top of the homepage and the different sections of the magazine labeled with a preview of the top article within each section. However, the New Yorker seems to have put a lot more thought into the design of their website because it’s simplicity makes it much more aesthetically pleasing than many other news/magazine websites. The top stories are placed at the top of the homepage in one larger rectangle with the different top stories changing every minute or so. Directly underneath are the top stories pertaining to each section of the magazine along with some web articles and media. The header is done in black and white with the iconic New Yorker “Irvin” font next to the illustration of the dandy man that was featured on the first issue.</p>
			<p>The overall look of the home pages appears much cleaner and streamlined than many other websites of this nature that I’ve seen. These types of websites have a tendency to look rather cluttered with many of the stories in a sort of disarray on the page. The New Yorker’s choice of color, mainly black and white with a bit of red and blue in the sub-header, mixed with the simplicity and organization, makes the website look almost elegant in comparison.</p>
			<p>Although some may find it outdated to use the same font and illustration from the original issue, I find that it really goes along with the New Yorker brand. Rather than attempting to modernize the look of the magazine every few years, by staying true to the original look and only making basic changes to update the quality of the magazine, the New Yorker has made themselves that much more recognizable and arguably iconic. It is clear, by their consistent use of the original font and illustrations from the original issue that they are very proud of the history of the magazine and how true it has always been to itself. By showcasing that and making it one of the main aspects, they seem to have achieved what they were looking to accomplish.</p>
			<p>Typically, the simplicity of the website, mixed with the consistency in the font and use of the dandy in their branding, would seem more basic and possibly a bit boring. However, after considering the fact that this is the New Yorker and thinking about the image that they are trying to keep, it works for what they want to achieve. It’s very obviously intentionally simple which really goes along with the brand. It also makes the website easier to navigate than other websites because it is laid out in such an organized manner with large titles. Coincidentally, this would theoretically make it much easier for some of their older readers to use the website.</p>
			<p>The individual sections within the website continue in the simplistic style of the home page.  They have a similar layout to many blogs with previews of each article in succession with the option to continue reading if the reader would like to read the full article.  The “Irvin” font is not used nearly as much on the rest of the website as it is on the homepage and part of me really wishes it was. The New Yorker is obviously very proud of the font that they’ve used since the beginning, and it doesn’t really make sense to use it so heavily in one part of the website and then to almost use it nowhere else throughout the rest of it. If they would prefer to use the much less stylistic font that they have used in the headers throughout the rest of the website then it would probably have worked more for them to use the “Irvin” font less on the home-page so that it is more balances, as the rest of the website is.</p>
			<p>The art in the New Yorker is generally better than average, which goes along with the upper class air the magazine exudes. The photography that is used before each article is generally better than the typical photojournalistic photography that appears in many other news websites and blogs. The way each photograph is shot shows that the photographer was trying to not only get a decent shot but to also make the image visually appealing as well.  Also, the continuation of illustrative methods throughout the website both keep with the original aspects of the magazine and again make it more visually appealing especially to the upper class reader who has some knowledge in art, that the average news reader might not have.</p>
			<p>Overall, I really think that the New Yorker has created a good representation of their magazine and their brand itself in the website. As always, they have stayed very true to their aesthetic, which has become so iconic and recognizable over the years. The New Yorker prides itself on being an upscale and high-class source of news and entertainment and the aesthetic they have created goes along with that. The look of the website as a whole is very streamlined and stylistic and although some parts are not exactly perfect they definitely have catered their website to their demographic which is what makes design work successful.</p>
